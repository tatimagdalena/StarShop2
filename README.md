# StarShop 2.0

### ðŸ§  This project is for studies purpose ðŸ§ 

This is an iOS Swift project simulating a Shopping app. It uses MVVM and [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift).

It is based on the [proposed challenge for mobile developer job openings](https://github.com/stone-payments/desafio-mobile/tree/master/store) at [Stone Pagamentos](www.stone.com.br).

The API requests are being mocked with an [Apiary project](https://starshop.docs.apiary.io/#).
